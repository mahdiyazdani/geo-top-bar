# How to Change Your Default Country?

## What Are the Cookies?

?> A cookie is often used to identify a user. A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too. With PHP, it is possible to create and retrieve cookie values.

Selecting a new or different country from the modal window will create a new cookie on your browser history and plugin will remember this choice up until 24 hours.

In case you want to delete the registered cookie manually, you need to follow browser guidelines to purge it from memory.
