# How to Change Bar Background Color?

The background color property in color scheme section applies solid colors as background on a message bar and default country modal window.

The example used below (#f9bf3b) is called a hex code, and it is one of the several ways that CSS has to represent a single solid color, Another way to declare a color is to use RGB or RGBa.

!> Unlike hex codes, these values allow for transparency (alpha), which can be super useful.

?> There is a clickable zone on the right and left sides of the slider to make it easier to get to **alpha values of 0 or 100**.

Navigate to **Appearance > Customize > GEO Top Bar > Color Scheme** and here you will be able to locate the **"Bar Background"** option.

### Property Values

* ```A HEX value```: ```#ff0000```
* ```An RGB value```: ```rgb(255, 0, 0)```
* ```An RGBa value```: ```rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)```

### RGBa Color Picker

WordPress uses the [Iris](http://automattic.github.io/Iris/) Color Picker as a tool which you can select a color for an input field in the WordPress customizer, out of the box you can only add a hex color and not an Alpha RGBa color type that supports transparency.

?> Since GEO Top Bar plugin extends existing ```wp-color-picker``` control you will be able to use and enter opacity or alpha value too!

### Default Country Modal

!> Note that opening the default country modal window while using the plugin in test mode is not possible.
