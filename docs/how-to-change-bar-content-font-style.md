### Property Values

* ```Normal```:  The **default** value. The browser displays a normal font style.
* ```Italic```: The browser displays an italic font style.
* ```Oblique```: The browser displays an oblique font style.
* ```Initial```: Sets this property to its default value.
* ```Inherit```: Inherits this property from its parent element.

## Italic vs. Oblique

According to the spec, "Italic forms are cursive in nature while oblique faces are typically sloped versions of the regular face." However, if the font being used does not have italic or oblique faces available, in most cases there is little, if any, a difference between italic and oblique.
