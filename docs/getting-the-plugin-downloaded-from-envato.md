# Getting the plugin downloaded from Envato

To download the installable plugin file, first, log into your [Envato](https://codecanyon.net) account.

Navigate to the Downloads section of your profile and find the [**GEO Top Bar Plugin**](https://goo.gl/BDahGU) then click on the **Download** (green) button. This will trigger a dropdown list for you to choose which files you want to download.


?> All files and Documentation. This option will download a .zip file which will include the plugin, documentation access, dummy data and the licensing information.


?> Installable WordPress files only. This option will just download the plugin in a .zip format to your WordPress site.


!> From the drop down menu click on the **Installable WordPress file only** to download the ready to install plugin only and the download will start automatically.

Whenever you are downloading the plugin files from Envato, you will get an archive file within **.zip** extension.
After downloading the files you will be able to find **mypreview-geo-top-bar.zip** on your local machine, in case you are seeing the folder without zip extension it means your browser automatically unzipped the downloaded file while downloading, you need to zip it again to be able to upload on WordPress.

*Thatâ€™s it. Hope this quick guide helps you save time and get to the point quickly.*
