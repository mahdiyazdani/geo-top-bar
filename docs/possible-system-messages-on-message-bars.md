?> To display message bar component on your website, you need to add some content into message text area field, if you leave this field empty, no message bar will be displayed.

?> Defining duplicate countries via repeater fields usually throws the above error message, and it prevents customizer from saving changes, to solve this you need to make sure you have selected each country only once.
