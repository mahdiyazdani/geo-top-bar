## Background Repeat

The background repeat property sets if/how a background image will be repeated.
By default, a background image is repeated both vertically and horizontally.

### Property Values

* ```No Repeat```: Don't tile, just show the image once.
* ```Tile```: The background image will be repeated both vertically and horizontally. This is the **default** value.
* ```Tile Horizontally```: The background image will be repeated only horizontally.
* ```Tile Vertically```: The background image will be repeated only vertically.

## Background Size

The background size property in CSS is one of the most useful — and most complex — of the background properties.

### Property Values

* ```Auto```: **Default** value. Auto tells the browser to automatically calculate the size based on the actual size of the image and the aspect ratio.
* ```Cover```: Cover tells the browser to make sure the image always covers the entire container, even if it has to stretch the image or cut a little bit off one of the edges.
* ```Contain```: Contain, says to always show the whole image, even if that leaves a little space to the sides or bottom.

## Background Position

The background position property allows you to move a background image around within its container and it sets the starting position of a background image too.

The first value is the **horizontal position** and the second value is the **vertical**. The **top left** corner is **0% 0%**. The **right bottom** corner is **100% 100%**. Default value is: **0% 0%** &mdash; **center center**

### Property Values

* ```left top```
* ```left center```
* ```left bottom```
* ```right top```
* ```right center```
* ```right bottom```
