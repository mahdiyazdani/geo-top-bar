# How to Preview Different Country Message Bar?

The preview mode allows you to see how content will look on various countries before actually saving and publishing it. How it actually works is that it creates a cookie version of the content, which can be previewed via the WordPress customizer only.

!> Message bar content and button will appear to be coming from the country you have chosen to preview.

Navigate to **Appearance > Customize > GEO Top Bar > Message Bars** and here you will be able to locate the **"Preview This"** option.
