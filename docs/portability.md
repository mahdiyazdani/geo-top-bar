# Importing & Exporting

GEO Top Bar has an extensive portability system that pulls every single setting of the plugin. Everything inside of GEO Top Bar controllers can be exported from one website and then imported into a new website. GEO Top Bar export feature is also an excellent way to backup all settings of your plugin with your peers. 

?> All configured plugin settings are contained in a single **JSON** file. When you import the file to a new website, your uploaded GEO Top Bar configuration will be ready to use!
