# Importing & Exporting

GEO Top Bar has an extensive portability system that pulls every single setting of the plugin. Everything inside of GEO Top Bar controllers can be exported from one website and then imported into a new website. GEO Top Bar export feature is also an excellent way to backup all settings of your plugin with your peers. 

?> All configured plugin settings are contained in a single **JSON** file. When you import the file to a new website, your uploaded GEO Top Bar configuration will be ready to use!

## Export Settings

Navigate to **Appearance > Customize > GEO Top Bar > Portability** and here you will be able to locate the **"Export Settings"** option.

Clicking this button will begin exporting your entire GEO Top Bar plugin settings. 

!> Exporting large amount of data and settings, especially those that contain lots of message bars for different countries, can take some extra time.

After the export process has completed, **your browser will automatically download a .JSON file**. This file can be used to import your exported items onto a new website using the **Import Settings** controller inside the portability section.
