> Display a highly customizable sleek message bar on your website. An ideal choice for informing visitors from specific geo locations.

## What is it

docsify generates your documentation website on the fly. Unlike GitBook, it does not generate static html files. Instead, it smartly loads and parses your Markdown files and displays them as website. All you need to do is create an `index.html` to start and [deploy it on GitHub Pages](deploy.md).

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) for more details.
